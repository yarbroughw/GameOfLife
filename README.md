Game of Life
===========

A year-old Processing implementation of Conway's Game of Life, as the final project for my first CS class. It's a bit old and clunky, and my programming-fu has evolved quite a bit in the past year, but it's a nice little toy.

### Usage
After running in Processing...

+ <ENTER> runs the game
+ <R> randomizes the grid
+ <SPACEBAR> to clear grid
+ Click/Click+Drag to turn cells on/off
